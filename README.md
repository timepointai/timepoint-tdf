# timepoint-tdf

**Timepoint Data Format** — JSON-LD interchange for temporal causal data. Every service in the Timepoint suite speaks TDF: Flash scenes, Pro simulation outputs, Clockchain nodes, SNAG-Bench scores, and Proteus predictions are all expressible as TDF records.

## Record Model

Each `TDFRecord` contains:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | str | Clockchain canonical URL or Flash/Pro UUID |
| `source` | Literal | `clockchain`, `flash`, `pro`, `proteus`, `snag-bench` |
| `timestamp` | datetime | When the record was created |
| `provenance` | TDFProvenance | Generator, run_id, confidence, flash_id |
| `payload` | dict | Source-specific content |
| `tdf_hash` | str | SHA-256 of canonicalized payload (content-addressed) |

## Transforms

| Function | Input | Output |
|----------|-------|--------|
| `from_flash(timepoint)` | Flash scene dict | TDFRecord (scene_data, character_data, dialog, metadata) |
| `from_pro(run_data)` | Pro run output dict | TDFRecord (entities, dialogs, causal_edges, metadata) |
| `from_clockchain(node)` | Clockchain node dict | TDFRecord (canonical URL as id, confidence in provenance) |

## I/O

```python
from timepoint_tdf import TDFRecord, from_flash, write_tdf_jsonl, read_tdf_jsonl

record = from_flash(timepoint_dict)
write_tdf_jsonl([record], "output.jsonl")
records = read_tdf_jsonl("output.jsonl")
```

## Install

```bash
pip install -e .
```

Requires Python 3.10+ and Pydantic 2.0+.
